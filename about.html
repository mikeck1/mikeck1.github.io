        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Team Walter Games, an indie game studio dedicated to crafting unique digital experiences designed for shared, in-person play. We believe that some of the best gaming moments happen when people gather around a single device, creating a modern twist on classic board game nights.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission at Team Walter Games is to create engaging, pass-and-play mobile games that foster connection and fun in social settings. Whether you're playing with friends passing a phone around, or engaging an entire classroom with a projector, our games are built to be intuitive, accessible, and perfect for shared enjoyment. We are actively expanding our game library and developing a dedicated hub and iOS app to easily access and manage our growing collection of digital mobile board games.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us at teamwaltergames@gmail.com
